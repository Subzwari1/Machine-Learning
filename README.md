# Machine-Learning

## California House Prices Prediction Project

### Overview

This project is part of my Master's degree work, focusing on predicting California house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is derived from the California Census data. The goal is to implement, evaluate, and compare different machine learning models to predict housing prices accurately.

### Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **src**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models**: Saved models for future use or further analysis.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.
- **requirements.txt**: Python libraries and dependencies needed to run the project.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various features like 'PropertyType', 'RoofMatl', 'RoofStyle', 'SaleCondition', 'SaleType', 'ScreenPorch', GarageArea', 'GarageCars', 'GarageCond', 'GarageFinish','Street'. The dataset is publicly available in this repository preprocessed for analysis through Data mining techniques.
