# Machine-Learning

## California House Prices Prediction Project

### Overview

This project is part of my Master's degree work, focusing on predicting house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is derived from the California Census data. The goal is to implement, evaluate, and compare different machine learning models to predict housing prices accurately.

### Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.
- **requirements.txt**: Python libraries and dependencies needed to run the project.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various features like 'PropertyType', 'RoofMatl', 'RoofStyle', 'SaleCondition', 'SaleType', 'ScreenPorch', GarageArea', 'GarageCars', 'GarageCond', 'GarageFinish','Street'. The dataset is publicly available in this repository preprocessed for analysis through Data mining techniques.

This project explores the following machine learning algorithms:

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - **C4.5 Algorithm**: A decision tree algorithm that builds a tree by splitting nodes based on the highest information gain.
   - **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)**: An algorithm that builds binary trees based on the Gini impurity metric.

2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming that the features follow a Gaussian distribution.

3. **Neural Network (MLP Classifier)**
   - A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier, a type of feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto appropriate outputs.
